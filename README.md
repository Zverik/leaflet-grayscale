# Leaflet.TileLayer.Grayscale

A regular TileLayer with grayscale makeover.

## Usage

Just use `L.tileLayer.grayscale(url, options)` instead of `L.tileLayer(url, options)`, also you need to set `crossOrigin: true` on `L.tileLayer` options.

I recommend using `fadeAnimation: false` option when creating the map object. Otherwise you
will see a lot of flickering.
